        Sudoku is a logic-based number placement puzzle.
        Starting with a partially completed 9x9 grid, the
        objective is to fill the grid so that each
        row, each column, and each of the 3x3 oxes
        (also called <i>blocks</i>) contains the digits
        1 to 9 exactly once.
